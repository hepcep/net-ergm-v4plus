### ðŸ›  Launching R in VS Code (Remotely on Oscar, @khanna7)

To work with this project in a **VS Code Remote SSH session**:

1. Open the workspace file:  
   `File â†’ Open Workspace from Fileâ€¦` â†’ `net-ergm-v4plus.code-workspace`

2. From the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), select:  
   **"Create R Terminal (new session)"**  
   > If the default "Create R Terminal" option does not work, try the one below it. This is about getting the right R loaded from the `renv`. 

3. Confirm the correct R environment is active:
   ```r
   .libPaths()
   renv::status()
   ```

**Note**: 
The VS Code workspace is configured to use `launch_R.sh` to start R with the correct environment:

- Loads the required R module on Oscar (`R/4.4.0`)
- Ensures `renv` activates correctly
- Avoids issues with missing libraries or misconfigured R paths

You don't need to run this script manually â€” it's automatically used when launching R via **"Create R Terminal (new session)"**.

To modify the setup (e.g., use a different R version or load additional modules), edit the `launch_R.sh` script at the project root.

Make sure it remains an executable:
```
chmod +x launch_R.sh
```
